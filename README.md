## What Web Scraper does
Web Scraper is a full-stack web application that allows users to scrape three broadcasting websites, view content from these sites, save articles, and post comments to these articles. The three broadcasting websites that are scraped are [BBC's World News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world), [CNN's Energy and Environment](https://www.cnn.com/specials/us/energy-and-environment) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/news/). 
Data retrieved from these sites include the article's title, a summary, an image, and a link to the article on the broadcaster's respective website. Users can post their opinions on an article and read the opinions of other users by saving the article and commenting. Websites are scraped upon the start of the server, every 24 hours, and when a user clicks the "Scrape!" `button`.
